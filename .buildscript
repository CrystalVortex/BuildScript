ECHO("This is an example file")

Everything that is not a BuildScript command is a comment like this one.
All commands are in upper case and it is like a function.
Each command MUST be under each other.

DIR("test") This creates a directory called 'test'

RUN("") Inside the "" put in an application name that you want to start

CWD("test") Go into a another directory (like cd)

GET("https://google.com") Download a file from the internet

UNZIP("") Inside the "" put a filename to unzip

SYSTEM("echo This is an example file") You can still use system commands using this
